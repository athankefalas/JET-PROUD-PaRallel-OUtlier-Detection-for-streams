/**
 * A collection of points that can be searched efficiently to find points near a given query point. A spatial index
 * takes two generic types. The first, {@code P}, is the base type of point for which distances can be measured. The
 * second, {@code E}, is the specific type of point contained within the index. The two ideas are separated because
 * callers may want to use an instance of {@code E} when querying the index. For example, an index that is used to
 * search for local businesses might have a base type of {@code GeospatialPoint}, but a specific type of
 * {@code HardwareStore}, which implements {@code GeospatialPoint} but has a number of additional required properties.
 * By separating the types, callers may realize the benefits of using a specific type when working with elements in the
 * index without the need to construct a new {@code HardwareStore} instance when querying points. Instead, they might
 * call {@link SpatialIndex#getNearestNeighbors(Object, int)} with a {@code new GeospatialPoint} instead of a much
 * heavier {@code HardwareStore}.
