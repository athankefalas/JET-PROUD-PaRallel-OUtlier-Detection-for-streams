 * A strategy for choosing a distance threshold for vp-tree nodes. The main feature of vp-trees is that they partition
 * collections of points into collections of points that are closer to a given point (the vantage point) than a certain
 * threshold or farther away from the vantage point than the threshold. Given a list of points, a
 * {@code ThresholdSelectionStrategy} chooses the distance that will be used by a vp-tree node to partition its points.
